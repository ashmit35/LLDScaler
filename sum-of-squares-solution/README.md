# Sum of Squares Parallel Streams(Assignment)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers and your task is to use parallel streams in Java 8 to find the sum of squares of all 
the even numbers in the given list. You need to apply parallel stream operations and a lambda expression to achieve 
this. 

The final result, which is the sum of squares of even numbers, should be returned.




## Instructions
1. Implement the `sumOfSquaresOfEvenNumbers` method inside the `SumOfSquares` class
2. You need to use **parallel streams** and **Lambdas** for doing the operation.
